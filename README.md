# Automatic Keyboard Player

The Automatic Keyboard Player is a project that combines the power of software and hardware automation to create a unique musical experience. By leveraging Python, LabVIEW, and servo motors, this project transforms MIDI files into real-time musical notes played on a keyboard.

## Features

- **MIDI File Conversion**: The system takes MIDI files as input and converts them into musical notes.
- **Real-time Playback**: Utilizing LabVIEW, the program classifies the notes and controls servo motors to play each note in real-time.
- **Hardware Integration**: Servo motors are used to physically press the keys on a keyboard, creating a tangible musical performance.
